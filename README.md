# easy-crypto
A WIP module aimed at providing a safer, easier to use and beginner friendly crypto API for Node.js

### Notice

This module is currently a work-in-progress. Please do not use it in production until before the `1.0.0` release since the API may break or might as well be outright unusable to unsafe.
